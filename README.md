# Nike-Vaporfly2

A project from my work experience at ElevenSix in the UK.

I was given an initial client prompt, detailing what they would like to achieve with the page and any key features to include. 
As this is my first experience with HTML and CSS, JavaScript was not included for functionality.

The aim of this project as to familiarise myself with the new languages, create a visually appealing design and apply client requirements. 
I had help from a front-end and back-end developer, along with hints and suggestions from the design team.

At the end of the two weeks, I presented the project to a team of 5 from multiple departments and recieved constructive feedback to imrpove functionality and design.
